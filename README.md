# Metagenome-Assembled Genomes of Macrocystis Associated Bacteria
Accompanying script and output files to the manuscript,  "Metagenome-Assembled Genomes of Macrocystis Associated Bacteria", in preparation for submission. 
We produced a dataset of of 1,794 metagenome assembled genomes (MAGs) which were dereplicated to 148 MAGs, across 178 Macrocystis pyrifera gametophyte samples, derived from raw fastq.gz sequences retrieved at NCBI with the accession PRJNA1050779. 

The MAGs generated in this dataset can be downloaded at NCBI under accession code: _______________.
